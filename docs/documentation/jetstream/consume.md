# Consuming Messages from Streams

Consuming messages from a stream can be done using one of three different methods depending on your application needs.
You can access these methods from the consumer object created using JetStream context:

```csharp
await using var nats = new NatsConnection();
var js = new NatsJSContext(nats);

var consumer = await js.CreateConsumerAsync(stream: "orders", consumer: "order_processor");
```

## Next Method

Next method is the simplest way of retrieving messages from a stream. Every time you call the next method, you get
a single message or nothing based on the expiry time to wait for a message. Once a message is received you can
process it and call next again for another.

```csharp
while (!cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
{
    var next = await consumer.NextAsync<Order>(serializer: orderSerializer);

    if (next is { } msg)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Processing {msg.Subject}: {msg.Data.OrderId}...");
        await msg.AckAsync();
    }
}
```

Next is the simplest and most conservative way of consuming messages since you request a single message from JetStream
server then acknowledge it before requesting more. However, next method is also the least performant since
there is no message batching.

## Fetch Method

Fetch method requests messages in batches to improve the performance while giving the application control over how
fast it can process messages without overwhelming the application process.

```csharp
while (!cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
{
    // Consume a batch of messages (1000 by default)
    await foreach (var msg in consumer.FetchAsync<Order>(serializer: orderSerializer))
    {
        // Process message
        await msg.AckAsync();

        // Loop ends when pull request expires or when requested number of messages (MaxMsgs) received
    }
}
```

## Consume Method

Consume method is the most performant method of consuming messages. Requests for messages (a.k.a. pull requests) are
overlapped so that there is a constant flow of messages from the JetStream server. Flow is controlled by `MaxMsgs`
or `MaxBytes` and respective thresholds to not overwhelm the application and to not waste server resources.

```csharp
await foreach (var msg in consumer.ConsumeAsync<Order>(serializer: orderSerializer))
{
    // Process message
    await msg.AckAsync();

    // loop never ends unless there is an error or a break
}
```

## Handling Exceptions

While consuming messages (using next, fetch or consume methods) there are several scenarios where exceptions might be
thrown by the client library, for example:

* Consumer is deleted by another application or operator
* Connection to NATS server is interrupted (mainly for next and fetch methods, consume method can recover)
* Client pull request is invalid
* Account permissions have changed
* Cluster leader changed

A naive implementation might try to recover from errors assuming they are temporary e.g. the stream or the consumer
will be created eventually:

```csharp
while (!cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
{
    try
    {
        await consumer.RefreshAsync(); // or try to recreate consumer
        await foreach (var msg in consumer.ConsumeAsync<Order>(serializer: orderSerializer))
        {
            // Process message
            await msg.AckAsync();
        }
    }
    catch (NatsJSProtocolException e)
    {
        // log exception
    }
    catch (NatsJSException e)
    {
        // log exception
        await Task.Delay(1000); // or back off
    }
}
```

Depending on your application you should configure streams and consumers with appropriate settings so that the
messages are processed and stored based on your requirements.
