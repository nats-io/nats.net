# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document contains `nats-io/nats.net.v2` specific contributing details. If you are a first-time contributor, please refer to the general [NATS Contributor Guide](https://nats.io/contributing/) to get a comprehensive overview of contributing to the NATS project.

## Getting started

There are three general ways you can contribute to this repo:

- Proposing an enhancement or new feature
- Reporting a bug or regression
- Contributing changes to the source code

For the first two, refer to the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.net.v2/issues/new/choose) which guides you through the available options along with the needed information to collect.

## Contributing Changes

_Prior to opening a pull request, it is recommended to open an issue first to ensure the maintainers can review intended changes. Exceptions to this rule include fixing non-functional source such as code comments, documentation or other supporting files._

Proposing source code changes is done through GitHub's standard pull request workflow.

If your branch is a work-in-progress then please start by creating your pull requests as draft, by clicking the down-arrow next to the `Create pull request` button and instead selecting `Create draft pull request`.

This will defer the automatic process of requesting a review from the NATS.Net team and significantly reduces noise until you are ready. Once you are happy with your PR, you can click the `Ready for review` button.

### Guidelines

A good pull request includes:

- A high-level description of the changes, including links to any issues that are related by adding comments like `Resolves #NNN` to your description. See [Linking a Pull Request to an Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) for more information.
- An up-to-date parent commit. Please make sure you are pulling in the latest `main` branch and rebasing your work on top of it, i.e. `git rebase main`.
- Unit tests where appropriate. Bug fixes will benefit from the addition of regression tests. New features will not be accepted without suitable test coverage!
- No more commits than necessary. Sometimes having multiple commits is useful for telling a story or isolating changes from one another, but please squash down any unnecessary commits that may just be for clean-up, comments or small changes.
- No additional external dependencies that aren't absolutely essential. Please do everything you can to avoid pulling in additional libraries/dependencies as we will be very critical of these.
